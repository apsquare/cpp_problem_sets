# Problem: Find the Index of First Occurrence in a String

### Description

Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the **index of the first occurrence** of `needle` in `haystack`.  
If `needle` is **not part of** `haystack`, return **-1**.

This is a classic string-search problem that tests your understanding of C++ string functions and algorithmic logic.

```cpp
Input:  haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
