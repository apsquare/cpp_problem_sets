# Search Insert Position

## Problem Description

Given a **sorted array of distinct integers** and a **target value**, implement a function to:

- Return the **index** of the target if it is found in the array.
- If the target is **not found**, return the **index where it would be inserted** to maintain the sorted order.

---

## Constraints

- The array is **sorted in ascending order**.
- All integers in the array are **distinct**.
- The algorithm must have **O(log n)** runtime complexity.

---

## Example

### Example 1

**Input:**

```text
nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 4
```
